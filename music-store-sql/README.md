# Music Store Analysis  

SQL project to analyze online music store data.

In this project I used SQL to do data analysis and answer some questions using various concepts in SQL. I've used Jupyter Notebook with **SQL magic functions** to keep the output in notebook itself and have done the analysis using SQL queries in the notebook itself to keep it real.
